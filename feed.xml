title: Code Freeze and Wierd Numbering
date:   2019-12-14 16:16:01 -0600
category: news
—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-wierd-version-numbering&quot;&gt;On wierd version numbering…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were under pressure to release a “version above 1.0” which seemed sort of arbitrary to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to just stick with our original schema, but take it x10.  Our last release was 0.14.0, and thus this release
is 14.1.  So if you’re wondering where versions 1.0-13.0 are, that’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14.1 is a long overdue fix for us releasing binaries for to use, instead of having to build your own.  0.14.0 was us finally
moving the old Map Reduce stuff out of the main trunk, because we haven’t been about that for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to help us test the release candidate, send an email to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dev-subscribe@mahout.apache.org&lt;/code&gt; and reply to the
confimration email to join our mailing list, and happy Mahouting!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>The Apache Software Foundation</name><email>dev@mahout.apache.org</email></author><summary type="html">&amp;lt;!– Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor license agreements.

title: Preparing for version 14.1
date:   2019-06-18 16:16:01 -0600
category: news
—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey all!  We’re preparing for Mahout version 14.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release might not seem super exciting from a user perspective (except 
we’re bumping Apache Spark to version 2.x and Scala to version 2.11) but
it includes some very important ‘behind the scenes changes’.  We’re doing a 
heavy refactoring which will combine &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;math-scala&lt;/code&gt; into a module 
called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; (no change to code required!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be moving H2o and Flink-batch engines into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;community&lt;/code&gt; that is to 
say the code will still be available, but we won’t be actively maintaining 
it (we will accept PRs though).  We’re moving the Map Reduce code to community
and have considered to once again accepting PRs against this code (if you have
an open PR, we’ll hit you up after the release about rebasing and considering to
resubmit the PR)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be updating the Java dependency from 1.7 to 1.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a LOT of old junk in the POMs which we have clipped out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned and &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=80&amp;amp;projectKey=MAHOUT&amp;amp;view=detail&amp;amp;selectedIssue=MAHOUT-2047&quot;&gt;feel free to help out&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>The Apache Software Foundation</name><email>dev@mahout.apache.org</email></author><summary type="html">&amp;lt;!– Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor license agreements.

&lt;p&gt;We’ve launced a new website, (a HUUUGE special thanks to David Miller from &lt;a href=&quot;http://startbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;StartBootstrap.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks great but there’s lots to do as we migrate and clean up content from the old site. If you see anything broken, 
please let us know via either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;send an email to dev@mahout.apache.org&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fix it yourself and &lt;a href=&quot;/developers/githubPRs&quot;&gt;open a PR&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
